      I think what makes Zen Garden so interesting is how completely different each page looks using the same html. This 
      emphasizes the ultimate divine power of CSS in creating beautiful webpages. My personal favorite was A Robot Named Jimmy.
      It looked how a lot of top-notch professional websites look, similar to the layout of something like 
      <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a> in the way that text is presented along images as you scroll down.

      One of the things that I totally read about in the reading that I read so thoroughly was <em>float</em>.
    Zen Gardens used float to control where elements ended up on the page. The most common were floating left or right, which 
    gave the nice effect of an image on one side with a block of text on the other side.

      One of the few things the Zen project used that wasn't explicitly mentioned in the book was border-top and border-bottom.
    This had the effect of creating a border at the top and bottom of the page, which could be edited in thickness and color. I
    was surprised to find that the book had talked about many of the effects and properties used in the style-sheet for the 
    gardens. This also spoke to the power of relatively simple CSS creating tremendous effect on websites.
